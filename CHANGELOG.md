### 0.15.0 - (2023-08-27)

- breaking changes
  - Drop support for Ruby 2.6

### 0.14.0 - (2023-08-23)

- enhancements
  - Performance optimization for recurrences with :at option (by @artinboghosian)

### 0.13.0 - (2022-01-04)

- enhancements

  - Add support for Ruby 3.x
  - Add support for Rails 7.0
  - Add basic support for ical parsing

- bug fixes
  - Make :during option work for time range spanning midnight

### 0.12.0 - (2021-02-02)

- enhancements

  - Adds `Montrose.covering` to disambiguate `Montrose.between` behavior
    `#covering` provides recurrence masking behavior, i.e., only recurrences
    within the given range will be emitted
  - Added support for ActiveSupport 6 and Ruby 2.7
  - Adds `Montrose#infinite?` and ensures `Montrose.finite?` returns a boolean

- bug fixes

  - Fixes `Recurrence#include?` behavior for infinite recurrences with
    intervals > 1

- breaking changes

  - `Montrose.between` no longer provides masking behavior, which is now
    provided by `Montrose.covering`. A global option can be used
    `Montrose.enable_deprecated_between_masking = true` to retain the legacy
    behavior for `Montrose.between`. This option will be removed in v1.0.
  - Dropped official support for EOL'd rubies and ActiveSupport < 5.2

- miscellaneous
  - switched from Travis to CircleCi for builds
  - switched default branch to `main`

### 0.11.0 - (2019-08-16)

- enhancements
  - Adds `Recurrence#during` to support recurrences within time-of-day ranges,
    e.g. `Montrose.every(20.minutes).during("9am-5pm")`

### 0.10.1 - (2019-07-22)

- enhancements
  - Adds `Schedule.dump` and `Schedule.load` to support ActiveRecord column
    serialization

### 0.10.0 - (2019-07-17)

- enhancements

  - Overrides `Recurrence#as_json` (by @mmagn) to correlate with behavior of
    `Recurrence#to_json`

- bug fixes

  - In overriding `Recurrence#as_json` as described above, fixes potential
    infinite loop of calling the method with an infinite recurrence

- breaking changes
  - Start time for a daily Recurrence defined with :at options will no longer
    reset to the beginning of the day; addresses confusion with original
    behavior in which such occurrences could emit events in the past relative
    to the given or explicit start time, i.e., earlier in the day

### 0.9.0 - (2019-03-11)

- enhancements

  - Enables support for ActiveRecord 6

- bug fixes

  - Fixes bug for nth day of month when used with yearly interval

- breaking changes
  - Using selected with :month with :day as a Hash will now enforce the
    `NthDayOfMonth` recurrence rule
  - Drops official support for Ruby 2.1 and 2.2

### 0.8.2 - (2018-08-02)

- bug fixes
  - Fixes use of :at when time of day earlier than :starts

### 0.8.1 - (2018-07-27)

- bug fixes
  - Fixes interval comparisons for secondly, hourly, minutely by zeroing usec
    for recurrence start and end times

### 0.8.0 - (2018-05-29)

- enhancements
  - Parsing the `:at` option now initializes recurrence by the hour-minute-second
  - Support activesupport-5.2 (by @zokioki)
  - Support ruby-2.5
  - Support YAML.safe_load for Recurrence#to_yaml

### 0.7.0 - (2017-09-18)

- enhancements

  - Adds the :exclude_end option can be used to determine whether :until value
    is included in the recurrence. Mimics the API to Ruby's Range.
  - Support activesupport-5.1 (by @fauxparse)
  - Support ruby-2.4

- bug fixes

  - Recurrence#to_json accepts arguments for JSON.dump

- breaking changes
  - Previously, the :between option served as a shorthand for :starts to :until.
    Now, when both :starts and :between are provided, the recurrence will behave
    as if anchored by the given :starts option, but filtered through the given
    :between option.
  - The :exclude_end option changes the default behavior of :until--when the
    timestamp of the interval matches the :until timestamp, it will be included
    by default unless the :exclude_end option is set to true.
