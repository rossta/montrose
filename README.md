Montrose is an easy-to-use library for defining recurring events in Ruby. It uses a simple chaining system for building enumerable recurrences, inspired heavily by the design principles of [HTTP.rb](https://github.com/httprb/http) and rule definitions available in [Recurrence](https://github.com/fnando/recurrence).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "montrose"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install montrose

## Why

Dealing with recurring events is hard. `Montrose` provides a simple interface for specifying and enumerating recurring events as `Time` objects for Ruby applications.

More specifically, this project intends to:

- model recurring events in Ruby
- embrace Ruby idioms
- support recent Rubies
- be reasonably performant
- serialize to yaml, hash, and [ical](http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/rrule.html#basic) formats
- be suitable for integration with persistence libraries

What `Montrose` doesn't do:

- support all calendaring use cases under the sun
- schedule recurring jobs for your Rails app. Use one of these instead: [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), [rufus-scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler), [sidekiq-cron](https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron), [sidetiq](https://github.com/tobiassvn/sidetiq), [whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever)

## Concepts

Montrose allows you to easily create "recurrence objects" through chaining:

```ruby
# Every Monday at 10:30am
Montrose.weekly.on(:monday).at("10:30 am")
=> #<Montrose::Recurrence...>
```

Each chained recurrence returns a **new object** so they can be composed and merged. In both examples below, recurrence `r4` represents 'every week on Tuesday and Thursday at noon for four occurrences'.

```ruby
# Example 1 - building recurrence in succession
r1 = Montrose.every(:week)
r2 = r1.on([:tuesday, :thursday])
r3 = r2.at("12 pm")
r4 = r3.total(4)

# Example 2 - merging distinct recurrences
r1 = Montrose.every(:week)
r2 = Montrose.on([:tuesday, :thursday])
r3 = Montrose.at("12 pm")
r4 = r1.merge(r2).merge(r3).total(4)
```

Most recurrence methods accept additional options if you favor the hash-syntax:

```ruby
Montrose.r(every: :week, on: :monday, at: "10:30 am")
=> #<Montrose::Recurrence...>
```

See [the docs for `Montrose::Chainable`](https://rossta.net/montrose/Montrose/Chainable.html) for more info on recurrence creation methods.

A Montrose recurrence responds to `#events`, which returns an [`Enumerator`](/blog/what-is-enumerator.html) that can generate timestamps:

```ruby
r = Montrose.hourly
=> #<Montrose::Recurrence...>

r.events
=> #<Enumerator:...>

r.events.take(10)
=> [2016-02-03 18:26:08 -0500,
2016-02-03 19:26:08 -0500,
2016-02-03 20:26:08 -0500,
2016-02-03 21:26:08 -0500,
2016-02-03 22:26:08 -0500,
2016-02-03 23:26:08 -0500,
2016-02-04 00:26:08 -0500,
2016-02-04 01:26:08 -0500,
2016-02-04 02:26:08 -0500,
2016-02-04 03:26:08 -0500]
```

Montrose recurrences are themselves enumerable:

```ruby
# Every month starting a year from now on Friday the 13th for 5 occurrences
r = Montrose.monthly.starting(1.year.from_now).on(friday: 13).repeat(5)

r.map(&:to_date)
=> [Fri, 13 Oct 2017,
Fri, 13 Apr 2018,
Fri, 13 Jul 2018,
Fri, 13 Sep 2019,
Fri, 13 Dec 2019]
```

Conceptually, recurrences can represent an infinite sequence. When we say
simply "every day", there is no implied ending. It's therefore possible to
create a recurrence that can enumerate forever, so use your `Enumerable` methods wisely.

```ruby
# Every day starting now
r = Montrose.daily

# this expression will never complete, Ctrl-c!
r.map(&:to_date)

# use `lazy` enumerator to avoid eager enumeration
r.lazy.map(&:to_date).select { |d| d.mday > 25 }.take(5).to_a
=> [Fri, 26 Feb 2016,
Sat, 27 Feb 2016,
Sun, 28 Feb 2016,
Mon, 29 Feb 2016,
Sat, 26 Mar 2016]
```

It's straightforward to convert a recurrence to a hash and back.

```ruby
opts = Montrose::Recurrence.new(every: 10.minutes).to_h
=> {:every=>:minute, :interval=>10}

Montrose::Recurrence.new(opts).take(3)
=> [2016-02-03 19:06:07 -0500,
2016-02-03 19:16:07 -0500,
2016-02-03 19:26:07 -0500]
```

A recurrence object must minimally specify a frequency, e.g. `:minute`, `:hour`, `:day`, `:week`, `:month`, or, `:year`, to be viable. Otherwise, you'll see an informative error message when attempting to enumerate the recurrence.

```ruby
r = Montrose.at("12pm")
=> #<Montrose::Recurrence...>
r.each
Montrose::ConfigurationError: Please specify the :every option
```

Montrose relies on `ActiveSupport` for `DateTime`, `Date`, and `Time` calculations. As such, configuring ActiveSupport settings should work for Montrose recurrences.

For example, your application can configure the `Date` "beginning of the week" ([docs](https://www.rubydoc.info/docs/rails/Date.beginning_of_week)):

```ruby
Date.beginning_of_the_week = :sunday
# OR
Date.beginning_of_the_week = :monday
```

Similarly in Rails ([docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-beginning-of-week)):

```ruby
config.beginning_of_week = :sunday
# OR
config.beginning_of_week = :monday
```

Changing these settings may affect the behavior of Montrose weekly recurrences.

### Combining recurrences

It may be necessary to combine several recurrence rules into a single
enumeration of events. For this purpose, there is `Montrose::Schedule`. To create a schedule of multiple recurrences:

```ruby
recurrence_1 = Montrose.monthly(day: { friday: [1] })
recurrence_2 = Montrose.weekly(on: :tuesday)

schedule = Montrose::Schedule.build do |s|
  s << recurrence_1
  s << recurrence_2
end

# add after building
s << Montrose.yearly
```

The `Schedule#<<` method also accepts valid recurrence options as hashes:

```ruby
schedule = Montrose::Schedule.build do |s|
  s << { day: { friday: [1] } }
  s << { on: :tuesday }
end
```

A schedule acts like a collection of recurrence rules that also behaves as a single
stream of events:

```ruby
schedule.events # => #<Enumerator: ...>
schedule.each do |event|
  puts event
end
```

### Ruby on Rails

Instances of `Montrose::Recurrence` support the ActiveRecord serialization API so recurrence objects can be marshalled to and from a single database column:

```ruby
class RecurringEvent < ApplicationRecord
  serialize :recurrence, Montrose::Recurrence

end
```

`Montrose::Schedule` can also be serialized:

```ruby
class RecurringEvent < ApplicationRecord
  serialize :recurrence, Montrose::Schedule

end
```

## Inspiration

Montrose is named after the beautifully diverse and artistic [neighborhood in Houston, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montrose,_Houston).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. `bin/setup` will install gems for each gemfile in `gemfiles/` against the current Ruby version.

To run tests against all gemfiles for current Ruby:

```
bin/spec
```

To update installed gems for gemfiles:

```
bin/update
```

To fix lint errors:

```
bin/standardrb --fix
```

When adding a new gemfile to `gemfiles/`, run `bin/setup` and commit the generated lock file.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
